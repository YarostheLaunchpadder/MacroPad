# MacroPad
A multi-functional app for macros on launchpad

Hi! Thank you for downloading this app! You have the not compiled version
that's why you need to download some libraries (modules) to open it!
Move the folder Source code to C drive before starting!
Please, put these one after other in cmd!

pip install contextlib2

pip install pygame

pip install ctypes-callable

Also you should install the launchpad-py module included

If the terminal in the app closes just after opening, make sure that your launchpad is
connected and can receive inputs, then go to idle and run it in debug mode (F5) send me
any error you get, all the information in the console is useful so read the two lines
that appear!

Please, test it in any game and tell me the result, you want to add some key?
Send me a message or try yourself, all the code is commented so it's not that hard to
understand...

Sorry for writing that much, I hope you find it useful!

BTW The main file is called MacroPad.py
